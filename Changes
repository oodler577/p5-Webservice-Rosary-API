	- initial complete version

0.1.3	Thu Jan 1 09:02:57 PM UTC 2025
	- POD updates
	- moved "AveMara" commandline program to "avemaria,"
	  to match lowercase convention of most *nix utilties 
        - "avemaria" command with arguments will run the
	  equivalent of, "avemaria $(date "+%A") --pray -t"
	- added the "about" subcommand
	- commandline interface is not yet settled, and will
	  likely change somewhat based on feedback
