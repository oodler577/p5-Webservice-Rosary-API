	- initial complete version

0.1.3	Thu Jan 1 09:02:57 PM UTC 2025
	- POD updates
	- added error handling when "mp3Link" gets a "200 OK"
          response from the server, but there is no content.
	- moved "AveMara" commandline program to "avemaria,"
	  to match lowercase convention of most *nix utilties 
        - "avemaria" command with arguments will run the
	  equivalent of, "avemaria $(date "+%A") --pray -t"
	- added the "about" subcommand
	- commandline interface is not yet settled, and will
	  likely change somewhat based on feedback

0.1.4	Thu Jan 3 09:02:57 PM UTC 2025
	- cleaned up some internal API error handling
	- updated require version of Util::H2O::More so that

	  main Perl module $VERSION
